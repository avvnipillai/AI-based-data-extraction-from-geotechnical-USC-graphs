# UCS Graph Digitization and Data Extraction

 Overview

This project focuses on **digitizing UCS (Unconfined Compressive Strength) graphs** from documents such as PDFs or scanned images and automatically extracting quantitative data from them. The extracted data is converted into a **machine-readable CSV/Excel format**, enabling seamless integration into geotechnical engineering analysis, modelling, and decision-making workflows.

Manual interpretation of UCS graphs is time-consuming and error-prone. This tool aims to automate that process using AI-based techniques.

Problem Statement

Engineering and geotechnical reports often contain UCS test results in graphical form. Extracting depth-wise UCS values manually from these graphs is inefficient and limits further computational analysis.

This project addresses the challenge of:

* Identifying UCS graphs from scanned documents or PDFs
* Detecting graph axes and key parameters
* Accurately extracting UCS values with respect to depth
* Converting extracted data into structured formats such as CSV

 Why This Matters

* Enables **automated data extraction** instead of manual interpretation
* Improves **accuracy and efficiency** in engineering analysis
* Allows easy integration with **engineering software and models**
* Supports data-driven decision-making in geotechnical engineering
